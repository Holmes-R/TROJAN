##KeyLogger
##Overview
This is a simple keylogger written in Python that captures keystrokes and mouse clicks. It records the currently active window and logs all keypresses and mouse clicks within that window. This script uses the pynput library to listen to keyboard and mouse events and the ctypes library to interact with the Windows API
